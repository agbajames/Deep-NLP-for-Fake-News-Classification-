# Summary:
This project focuses on the classification of fake news by fine-tuning a pre-trained XLNet model. Fake news has become a significant issue, and machine learning techniques offer efficient and effective ways to identify and combat it. The study utilizes the FakeNewsNet dataset, which consists of labeled real and fake news articles from PolitiFact and GossipCop. The pre-processing pipeline prepares the data by converting text to lowercase, expanding contractions, removing special characters and stop words, and tokenizing the text. The proposed model, XLNet, is a state-of-the-art language model based on the Transformer-XL architecture, with a permutation-based language modeling objective. The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score metrics and compared with baseline models such as CNN-URG, BERT, and BERT+LSTM. The results demonstrate that the fine-tuned XLNet model achieves superior accuracy compared to the baselines, showcasing its potential in detecting fake news. This project contributes to the ongoing efforts to develop natural language processing techniques for identifying and combating fake news.
